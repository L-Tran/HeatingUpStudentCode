We thought a lot through the lens of graph theory, representing each temperature as a node and only having directed edges. It is easy to turn the board into a graph, but we did not quiet figure out how to find the longest run. Aishah also had an idea that used induction that was very confusing. Lucas and Jack made this table that represented the temps and had different boxes for the various lengths that seemed a little promising. This problem seems very hard and I do not have many ideas. |

I spent around 15 with myself, trying to come up with potential solutions for the problem set with zero success, so I started to do some online research. I figured out that this type of problem is called a LIS (Longest increasing subsequence) pattern. I watched a couple videos that went over what they were and dynamic programming came up, which I learned is essentially breaking the problem down into smaller sub-steps that help solve the overall problem. Using this knowledge, I know the solution now involves zooming in on finding smaller distances, and using that info to find the largest. |
| January 14 |  8pm-9:30pm   | I decided to take a stab at implementing my dynamic coding/smaller subsequences. I first took care of the edge case of when the array is empty. I then made an array the size of the temp array to store how long each starting sequence was. I then made a counter that would hold the a current max_temp as I went through the array. My thinking was that I can record the current length of what I was at with each element in my new array, and as a new temp would pop up, I would compare it to the max temp and if it was greater, I would add the longest length before to that element of the array. This was pretty smart in theory but I got stuck on how to check if it was greater than ALL the elements before. I suspect there should be a nested for loop with an if condition with a comparison in it, but that is how far I got. |

I looked at the slides and after a short refresher on the recursive method, finished coding. I was a bit confused at first because I did not have another array to keep track of the steps it took to get to each temperature to help the recursive method, but once I figured that out everything made sense. I thought I was done with coding, but each test case would always be wrong with my code getting 0 for every test. Lucas took a quick look at my code and he spotted that I never actually updated maxLength. It was a short fix but I am mad that I couldn't spot it at first. |
