| January 13 | 11:25-11:55am |                        We did a lot of thinking in class about potential ideas and our best solutions are only have the efficiency of n^2 and are not even proven. We thought a lot through the lens of graph theory, representing each temperature as a node and only having directed edges. It is easy to turn the board into a graph, but we did not quiet figure out how to find the longest run. Aishah also had an idea that used induction that was very confusing. Lucas and Jack made this table that represented the temps and had different boxes for the various lengths that seemed a little promising. This problem seems very hard and I do not have many ideas. |
| January 13 |    9-10pm     | I was feeling pretty lost after class and my mind was empty. I spent around 15 with myself, trying to come up with potential solutions for the problem set with zero success, so I started to do some online research. I figured out that this type of problem is called a LIS (Longest increasing subsequence) pattern. I watched a couple videos that went over what they were and dynamic programming came up, which I learned is essentially breaking the problem down into smaller sub-steps that help solve the overall problem. Using this knowledge, I know the solution now involves zooming in on finding smaller distances, and using that info to find the largest. |
